//! Fuzzing harness to verify that the three methods of sketching produce correct and consistent results.
//!
//! Specifically, we will test the following three properties:
//! * That the estimated exclusive overlap cardinalities are correct for the given two vector sets
//! * That the estimated exclusive differences cardinalities are correct for the given two vector sets
//! * That the method that produces at once the overlap and difference cardinalities is consistent with the two previous methods
