This is a Rust library that provides an implementation of the HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm, trying to be parsimonious with memory.
It also provides an implementation based on the MLE algorithm, which is a more accurate version of the HyperLogLog algorithm but is slower.

You can use it to estimate the cardinality of large sets, and determine also the union and intersection of two sets.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hyperloglog = "0.1"
```

## Examples

```rust
use hyperloglog_rs::prelude::*;

let mut hll = HyperLogLog::<Precision14, Bits5, <Precision14 as ArrayRegister<Bits5>>::ArrayRegister>::default();
hll.insert(&1);
hll.insert(&2);

let mut hll2 = HyperLogLog::<Precision14, Bits5, <Precision14 as ArrayRegister<Bits5>>::ArrayRegister>::default();
hll2.insert(&2);
hll2.insert(&3);

let union = hll | hll2;

let estimated_cardinality: f32 = union.estimate_cardinality();
assert!(
estimated_cardinality >= 3.0_f32 * 0.9 &&
estimated_cardinality <= 3.0_f32 * 1.1,
"Expected cardinality to be around 3, got {}",
estimated_cardinality
);

let intersection_cardinality: f32 = hll.estimate_intersection_cardinality(&hll2);

assert!(
        intersection_cardinality >= 1.0_f32 * 0.9 &&
        intersection_cardinality <= 1.0_f32 * 1.1,
        "Expected intersection cardinality to be around 1, got {}",
        intersection_cardinality
);
```

### Using MLE estimation
The [MLE estimation for HyperLogLog counters by Otmar Ertl](https://oertl.github.io/hyperloglog-sketch-estimation-paper/paper/paper.pdf) provides a more accurate estimation of the cardinality of a set, but it is slower than the standard HyperLogLog algorithm. Here is an example of how to use it:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "std")]
{
        use hyperloglog_rs::prelude::*;

        let mut hll1: MLE<2, HyperLogLog::<Precision14, Bits5, <Precision14 as ArrayRegister<Bits5>>::ArrayRegister>> = MLE::default();
        
        hll1.insert(&1);
        hll1.insert(&2);
        hll1.insert(&3);

        let mut hll2: MLE<2, HyperLogLog::<Precision14, Bits5, <Precision14 as ArrayRegister<Bits5>>::ArrayRegister>> = MLE::default();

        hll2.insert(&2);
        hll2.insert(&3);
        hll2.insert(&4);

        let estimated_cardinality: f32 = hll1.estimate_cardinality();
        assert!(
                estimated_cardinality >= 3.0_f32 * 0.9 &&
                estimated_cardinality <= 3.0_f32 * 1.1,
                "MLE: Expected cardinality to be around 3, got {}",
                estimated_cardinality
        );

        let estimate_intersection_cardinality: f32 = hll1.estimate_intersection_cardinality(&hll2);

        assert!(
                estimate_intersection_cardinality >= 2.0_f32 * 0.9 &&
                estimate_intersection_cardinality <= 2.0_f32 * 1.1,
                "MLE: Expected intersection cardinality to be around 2, got {}",
                estimate_intersection_cardinality
        );
}
```

## No STD
This crate is designed to be as lightweight as possible and does not require any dependencies from the Rust standard library (std). As a result, it can be used in a bare metal or embedded context, where std may not be available. The only feature that requires std is the MLE estimation, which is optional.

## Fuzzing
Fuzzing is a technique for finding security vulnerabilities and bugs in software by providing random input to the code. We make sure that our fuzz targets are continuously updated and run against the latest versions of the library to ensure that any vulnerabilities or bugs are quickly identified and addressed.
